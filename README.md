Sign in, search for recipes, add them if you want, then delete them if they're gross. :)

Sometimes the recipe won't link to a recipe card, and I'll give you a little error message :(
The API doesn't like certain recipes for some reason. I'm working on manually setting the ingredients and cooking steps instead of using the "recipe card" option that the API offers, as it's unreliable. 

Things that I've learned with this project:

-- How to work with a database. 

-- Basic Authentication
